## pbi-tools Core Edition

The previous releases of `pbi-tools` were limited in that the tool needed to run alongside Power BI Desktop, hence in an interactive environment. That was insufficient for fully automated DevOps scenarios. Hence, `pbi-tools` now exists in two flavors: The _Desktop CLI_ and the _Core CLI_. The latter is a cross-platform executable running on top of .Net 5. The Core edition does not require Power BI Desktop to be installed. For that reason it comes with a restricted feature set. A full DevOps workflow will require both editions to be used at different stages.

Put simply, the _Desktop CLI_ is used interactively by individual developers committing changes into a code repository. The _Core CLI_, in turn, will then run on a build/deployment system. It reads and understands PBIX sources and can transform/compile/deploy those artifacts.

The _Core CLI_ is called `pbi-tools.core` (`pbi-tools.core.exe` on Windows) and available to download from the GitHub releases page for Windows x64, Linux x64, and Linux/Alpine x64:

## 'pbi-tools deploy' Action

Alongside the new _Core CLI_ comes the new [`deploy` CLI Action](/cli/usage.html#deploy). It completes the `pbi-tools` DevOps story and uses a declarative deployment model, with a deployment manifest held in source control just like other PBIX sources:

Integrating the system (for example) into an Azure DevOps Pipeline is very simple and produces output similar to this:

We'll be providing additional articles and tutorials demonstrating the new features. There is a much bigger vision here, and this is the very first step.
